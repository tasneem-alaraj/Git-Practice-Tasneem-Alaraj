## Part 1: Theoretical Questions

### 1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
- **Git** is a free and open-source distributed version control system used locally to track code changes.
- **GitHub** is an online platform that hosts Git repositories and simplifies collaboration through a user-friendly interface.
- 
### 2. Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.
- `git fetch`: Downloads the latest changes from the remote repo but doesnâ€™t merge them into your working directory.
- `git pull`: Fetches the changes from the remote repo **and merges** them into your current branch.

### 3. What is the purpose of `.gitignore` file?
- It tells Git which files or directories to ignore (not track).This is useful to avoid pushing temporary files like logs files.

### 4. Describe the steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub.
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository locally.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your edits and commit them.
5. Push the changes to your fork.
6. Submit a Pull Request to the original repository.
 
## Task Summary
